# 3Pass-Goal
C# Console Project

In order to ensure that a randomly selected player from the 11 players in the team successfully scores a goal after making 3 successful passes, the conditions for passing and scoring goals are adjusted with certain algorithms. Random values are assigned to the players' attributes, and based on the selected attributes, calculations are performed to determine the success of the pass and the success of the goal.
